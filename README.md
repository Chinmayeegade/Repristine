## Problem Statement
As we traverse through the 21st century, make our way through the technological era, trying to keep up with the modern age, we are excessively destroying nature and our planet and environmental Hazards are exponentially increasing by the day. 
All of us are constantly advised to protect and preserve the environment, the adverse effects of the increasing pollution, and the mantra of 'Recycle, Reuse and Reduce' is one we have been perpetually been upskilled about.
However, knowing just the trivial theoretical base of the happening reality is insufficient to change people's habits and ways. 
Even though we all know that environmental preservation is each person's fundamental responsibility, we remain confounded as to how we can contribute towards saving our nature at an individual level.
Although we all aspire to contribute to environmental preservation, we often lack proper information or ideas to lend a helping hand. 

## Proposed Solution
Ceasing modernization is definitely not an option, but we can use the fundamentals of growing technology to build a dais where people all around the world can share their ideas about recycling, reducing and reusing their waste, they can help others find solutions to faced environmental problems and can play their part in achieving the global goal and rewilding mother nature. 
Repristine is a Kotlin based android application built using Android Studio and aims to function as a social media platform created to ease abiding by the fundamentals of environmental protection for all by providing a stage to share ideas, articles, opinions, and much more!
